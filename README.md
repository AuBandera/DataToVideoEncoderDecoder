# (Demo) Challenge 1: misc
Found a weird video but not sure what is it? You have came to the correct place!

## Execution

### Windows

Get executables from [Releases](https://github.com/AuBandera/DataToVideoEncoderDecoder/releases/new) and run with correct parameters from command line

### Linux / Mac OS

To execute this project you'll need to install the dependencies included in the requirements.txt file. Navigate to the folder in a terminal and run the following command.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Prepare the file you want for encoding. You can also add music to the video if you wish. Run:

```bash
  python encoder.py file.txt output.mp4 default.mp3
```

The process will take some time. Larger files require more RAM, and a 100MB file was observed to use 100GB of RAM. This is not a practical way of storing files.
